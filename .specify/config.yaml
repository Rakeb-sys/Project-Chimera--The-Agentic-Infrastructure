# Minimal Spec Kit config stub
ai: copilot
initialized: false
notes: |
  The real Spec Kit CLI init was not executed because the installed
  `specify` package in `.venv` appears to be a different project (a test runner).
  If you want the official Spec Kit initialized here, tell me the package
  name to install (PyPI or npm) and I'll install and run it.

# Context Engineering Rules

1. **Define Clear Objectives**  
    Clearly state the purpose and goals of context engineering for each project.

2. **Data Collection**  
    Gather relevant and high-quality contextual data from trusted sources.

3. **Context Representation**  
    Structure and encode context information in a consistent and machine-readable format.

4. **Context Validation**  
    Regularly validate and update context data to ensure accuracy and relevance.

5. **Privacy and Security**  
    Protect sensitive context data by applying appropriate privacy and security measures.

6. **Context Adaptation**  
    Design systems to dynamically adapt to changing context in real-time.

7. **Interoperability**  
    Ensure context data can be shared and understood across different systems and platforms.

8. **Scalability**  
    Architect context management solutions to handle growth in data volume and complexity.

9. **Auditability**  
    Maintain logs and records of context changes for traceability and debugging.

10. **User Control**  
     Provide mechanisms for users to view, modify, or opt out of context usage.

# Project Chimera AI Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system using MCP multi-agent architecture.

## Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.

## Traceability Requirement
Before writing code:
1. Explain plan
2. Reference specification section
3. Justify implementation approach

## Governance
- Every function must match API contracts
- Skills must define Input/Output clearly
- Tests must exist before logic implementation
